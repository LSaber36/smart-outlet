# app
This directory will hold all of the code that allows the app to work.
The app design markup can be seen here [here](https://www.figma.com/file/I3UxsxEzIsTp0hYgttS95y/Smart-Outlet?node-id=0%3A1)

NOTE: The firebase communication will not work without the google-services.json file being in the android/app folder. This is being left out for security purposes.
